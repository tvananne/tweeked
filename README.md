# Tweeked

## Goal: to demystify the Twitter API using Python (2.7)
I would like to help others understand how the Twitter API works

##Set up your own twitter 'app'
Please note, you will need to log into twitter with your account and go to https://apps.twitter.com and register your own application. You can
make the website http://www.google.com if you don't have a website. Leave the callback url blank.

After your app is created, go to "Keys and Access Tokens" tab and take a note of the consumer key and
secret. Those should be copied into the 'tweeked.py' script. 

Then you will need to scroll down on that same page and click the button that says something along the 
lines of "generate Access Token and Secret." Once those have also been generated, copy those into the 
'tweeked.py' script as well. Now you should be able to run the 'tweeked.py' script with your own credentials!

##Set up the script to do what you want
I will be modifying the script to take advantage of all of the defined functions in 'tweeked.py'

Currently, the only functions called are the 'get_limits()' and the 'get_tweets()' functions. Feel free to explore the others
on your own until I set up the demos for those!

###Thanks!
